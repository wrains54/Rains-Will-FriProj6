# Tkinter Geometry Managers Examples

This repository contains three simple Python scripts demonstrating the use of Tkinter's geometry managers: `pack`, `grid`, and `place`. Each script creates a basic GUI application with Tkinter, showcasing how to structure and position widgets using different geometry management methods.

## 1. Pack Geometry Manager Example

**Filename:** `pack_example.py`

This script demonstrates the use of the `pack` geometry manager to create a simple GUI window. The `pack` manager is used to place widgets in a block-like structure, stacking them either vertically or horizontally.

## 2. Grid Geometry Manager Example

**Filename:** `grid_example.py`

This script showcases the `grid` geometry manager, creating a sign-up page with fields for Name, Email, and Password, and a "Sign Up Now" button. The `grid` manager arranges widgets in a table-like structure, allowing for complex layouts.

## 3. Place Geometry Manager Example

**Filename:** `place_example.py`

This script uses the `place` geometry manager to create a login page with Username and Password fields and a "Login" button. The `place` manager positions widgets based on x and y coordinates, providing precise control over widget placement.

## Usage

To run any of these scripts, you need Python and Tkinter installed on your system.
